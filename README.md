# humble_counter

This is a counting app that allows you to:         

* check if a number is prime (a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself) 
* compute the “nth” prime (this is actually doing an API request to [Wolfram Alpha](https://wolframalpha.com), a scientific computing API)
* ask for a fact about a number (which actually makes a request to [NumbersAPI](http://numbersapi.com) service for the fact)
* save and share your favorite facts.

The app is inspired by the series of [Point Free](https://pointfree.co) episodes and was born as a result of my first steps of learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).
